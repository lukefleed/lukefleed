# Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ––

Hello There! I'm attending the last year of the Bachelor's Degree in Computational Mathematics at the University of Pisa, in the meantime, I'm also attending the Master's Degree in Computer Science.

I am also a member of [PHC](https://phc.dm.unipi.it/), a group of enthusiastic students about technology, software, hardware, and how they work together. We manage a few servers, websites and services for the mathematics department students. Sometimes we also organize seminars about various topics related to math and computer science (often together!).

Here are some of my **research interests**:

* ðŸ“˜ Algorithms and data structures</li>
* ðŸ“• Succinct data structures and data compression</li>
* ðŸ“— Graph theory and high-performance computing</li>
* ðŸ“™ Rust and low-level code optimization</li>

These are my most used languages (most of my Rust code is still private though, so it's not 100% accurate)
