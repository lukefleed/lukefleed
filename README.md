# Hello there! Welcome to my Github page ðŸ––

I'm currently attending the last year of the Bachelor Degree in Computational Mathematics at the University of Pisa. I'm also a content editor at MoreThanTech! My mathematical and CS interests are:

* Graph Theory
* Algorithms and Data Structures
* Numerical Analysis

I mostly write in C++ and Python and love to write LaTeX documents.
