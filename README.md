# Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ––

Hello There! I'm a mathematician who turned to the dark side of computer science. I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics and am currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Pisa, Italy.

I am also a member of [PHC](https://phc.dm.unipi.it/), a group of enthusiastic students about technology, software, hardware, and how they work together. We manage a few servers, websites, and services for students in the mathematics department. Sometimes, we also organise seminars on various topics related to math and computer science (often together).

Here are some of my **research interests**:

* ðŸ“• Succinct data structures and data compression</li>
* ðŸ“˜ Algorithms and data structures</li>
* ðŸ“— High-performance computing</li>
* ðŸ“™ Rust and low-level code optimization</li>
