# Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ––

Hello There! I'm a mathematician who turned to the dark side of computer science. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics and I'm currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Pisa, Italy. My main interests are in the fields of:

* ðŸ“• Succinct data structures and data compression
* ðŸ“˜ Algorithms and data structures
* ðŸ“— High-performance computing
* ðŸ“™ Rust and low-level code optimization

I am also a member of [PHC](https://phc.dm.unipi.it/), a group of enthusiastic students about technology, software, hardware, and how they work together. We manage a few servers, websites and services for the mathematics department students. Sometimes we also organize seminars about various topics related to math and computer science (often together!)
